# IrisDetection-Real-time-and-Single-Image
## Welcome to IrisDetection, a dynamic and flexible iris detection project that caters to both real-time webcam analysis and single-image iris detection. This project empowers you to harness the power of iris recognition in two distinct modes, enhancing your ability to identify and analyze irises with ease and accuracy.

## Features:

### IrisDetection offers a unique dual-mode functionality that sets it apart. With the real-time webcam analysis mode, you can seamlessly detect and track irises in live video streams, making it ideal for applications such as biometric authentication and surveillance.

### Alternatively, the single-image mode allows you to process individual iris images, enabling in-depth analysis and identification for a wide range of use cases, including research, forensic analysis, and identity verification.

### Both modes harness advanced iris detection algorithms that have been fine-tuned for accuracy and speed. Our project boasts a user-friendly interface designed to provide a hassle-free experience, whether you're new to iris recognition or a seasoned professional.

### IrisDetection is your gateway to unlocking the potential of iris-based identification and analysis. Seamlessly switch between real-time and single-image modes, and discover the versatility and reliability of iris detection for your projects and applications.
